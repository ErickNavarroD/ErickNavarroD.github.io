title: RAMEN - Regional Association of Methylome variability with the Exposome and geNome

summary: R package whose goal is to identify Variable Methylated Regions (VMRs) in microarray DNA methylation data. Additionally, using Genotype (G) and Environmental (E) data, it can identify which G, E, G+E or GxE model better explains this variability.s

Regional Association of Methylome variability with the Exposome and geNome (RAMEN) is an R package whose goal is to identify Variable Methylated Regions (VMRs) in microarray DNA methylation data. Additionally, using Genotype (G) and Environmental (E) data, it can identify which G, E, G+E or GxE model better explains this variability.
